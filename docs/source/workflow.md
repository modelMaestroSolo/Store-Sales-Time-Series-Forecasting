# PROJECT WORKFLOW

## Business Understanding
We begin the project by talking to stakeholders to understand their needs and the problem they seek to solve. 

Outcomes:

- Clearly stated and refine research question/initial hypothesis.
- Clearly stated objectives(outcomes aimed to achieve) 
- Success criteria and deliverables are defined. 

## Initial Data Exploration 
This is done to 
1. Gain familiarity with dataset 
2. Check if data meets the specifications outlined in metadata 
3. Document the data surface properties and content quality
4. Assess potential of data to achieve project objectives. 

outcomes: 

- A data dictionary is build as a summary of findings to aid understanding of data.
 


## In-depth Exploratory Analysis and Data Cleaning. 
Perform in-depth analysis to understand trends, patterns and relatioships. Exploring data to gain insights for informed choices during data cleaning, feature engineering, model building etc.  

Outcomes: 

- Insights on trends, patterns and relationships. useful for proposing recommendations, informed decision making during data cleaning, feature engineering etc.  
- Visualizations for powerbi deployment, article and reports. 
- Data cleaning steps obtained to create python script to automate cleaning. 

## Data Wrangling and Preparation 
Prepare data for modelling
