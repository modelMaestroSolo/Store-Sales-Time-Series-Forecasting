# Project Title 

Forecasting Store Sales for Improved Decision-Making Using Machine Learning for Time Series Data

## Project Overview
Accurate forecasting of sales is crucial for businesses across various industries as it provides several tangible benefits that contribute to improved decision-making and overall business performance. Some of the key ways in which accurate sales forecasting can positively impact a business include: Optimized inventory management; efficient allocation of resources such as human resources, production capacity, marketing budgets; Optimized production schedules; Effective marketing strategies; etc. 

The **AIM** of this project is to build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores. 

Corporation Favorita is a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer

## Set-up and Installation

To set up the project locally and reproduce the results, follow the steps below:
First navigate to the directory to be used for the project, open the terminal(you can type "cmd" in the path bar to open terminal from the folder):

1. Create a new python virtual environment:

```console
python -m venv *venv_name*
```
2. Activate your *venv_name* :
```console
.\venv_name\Scripts\activate
```
3. clone project repo with git clone command

4. Install the dependencies in the requirement.txt
```console
(venv_name) pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Now you can experiment with the codes. Refer to the  *references directory* to understand folder struture. 


## Usage
